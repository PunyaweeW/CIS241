        <h2>Get to know me a little</h2>
        <p>First of all welcome to my website. My name is Punyawee Wijitkosum. You can call me Ivy for short, but almost
            of my friends call me Somchaiyz which is my AKA. In my free time, I love to play games with my friends, and
            enjoy to hip hop music. I am a big brother in my family, and I have one younger sister. I and my sister used
            to study at Marie Vithaya School which is Christain Chartholic and also graduated high school from Marie
            Vithaya</p>
        <p>I continue my study at Khon Kaen University and graduated from Khone Kaen University at department of
            Computer Engineering. I used to be president of Engineering Boxing Club when I was in the university. When I
            studied in the university, I was not a good student as I should be, so this is the reason which makes me
            graduated slower than my friends for one semester.
            Even I still studied on the last semester, I tried to find a job in position of software developer, and I
            got it. I got a job at ODD-E Thailand, even ODD-E Thailand does not hire new employees, becuase company's
            slogan is <strong>'We are not hiring'</strong>.
            The reason that I got this job is I used to be an intern at ODD-E Thailand, so I knew some of them. I had
            sent direct message to my senior in the company before they let me to be one of their parts.</p>
        <p>I worked as software developer at ODD-E Thailand, and I had worked at the company for 1 years and 9 months. I
            love to work with all people in the company, because almost of them are so smart, and they have positive
            energy so much, even works to do at the company are a lot. Every team tries hard to deviler project in time,
            and they usually do it. I am so pround that I used to be one of their parts.</p>
        <p>I dicided to continue my study in America for more oppotunities in my career path after I had worked at ODD-E
            for almost 2 years. Now, I am student at Edmonds College, and I study Computer Information System in the
            area of Web Application Developer Certificate
            I try hard on my study because I do not want it to be like my life in the univeristy. I enjoy life in
            America so much, and I plan to find some job after I graduated from the Edmonds College, or I maybe continue
            my study at master degree if I can. I would like to say 'Thank You' for all of you that read from the begin
            to the last of my paragraph.
