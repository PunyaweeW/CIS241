            CIS-241 41 Web Development 1 gives a lot of useful knowledgement, even I have studied in the area of
            computer since I was in the university.
            This class let me study deeper than I used to study from the university, because I studied only parts which
            materials contained coding skill at first time, but this class has other materials, such as business, mobile
            size, and etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best part for me is Images techniques, and Content Flow. I like both of them, because they have some
            techniques which I have never known about a little detail, and I think all of them is usefully.
            I also like discussion part, because I can get some more knowledge in this part, and I like to read other
            class mates post, because they sometimes give me a different point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even I have coded for a long time, but I have been still interested in CSS, because CSS can be compared as
            people's dress if HTML is human's structure, and it can make beautiful web sites. I know that customers
            sometimes like beautiful more than functionality.
